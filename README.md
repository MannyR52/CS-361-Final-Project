# Fitness Web App – Microservices Architecture
## Overview

This project is a fitness-focused web application built using a microservices architecture to promote modularity and scalability. It includes four microservices that handle BMI calculation, randomized workout generation, user authentication with encrypted credentials, and a workout log with full CRUD functionality. This project emphasizes secure user management, RESTful API design, and inter-service communication while demonstrating best practices in backend development.
### Features:

-    BMI Calculation – Computes Body Mass Index based on user input.
-    Random Workout Generator – Provides a randomized workout from a JSON dataset.
-    User Authentication – Secure sign-up and sign-in system with password encryption.
-    Workout Log – Users can add, update, delete, and view their workout history.
-    Microservices Architecture – Each feature runs as an independent service for scalability.

### Technologies Used

-    Python – Backend logic and API development.
-    Flask – Web framework for handling API requests.
-    SQLite/MySQL – Database management for storing user data.
-    RESTful APIs – Enables communication between microservices.
-    JSON – Data storage for workout routines.
-    Encryption Libraries – Securely store user passwords.

### Learning Outcomes

-    Microservices Development – Implemented loosely coupled and scalable services.
-    Secure Authentication – Used hashed passwords to protect user credentials.
-    Database Management – Designed relational databases with proper CRUD operations.
-    API Design – Built and integrated RESTful APIs for service communication.
-    Data Handling – Managed JSON-based data storage and retrieval.
